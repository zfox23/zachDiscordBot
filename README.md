# Stable Discord Bot
A Discord bot that I use on my Discord server. I hope you find it useful too!

The bot is based on [the awesome `discord.js` library](https://discord.js.org).

## Features
Stable Discord Bot supports several powerful and useful features, some of which are associated with invokable commands.

After you've invited Stable Discord Bot into your server, type `!help` to see all available commands.

Top features include:
1. A powerful quote saving and retrieval system that beautifully formats quotes and includes timestamps.
    - Start the quote system by reacting to any message with the "ðŸ” " emoji.
2. A YouTube playlist feature that allows you and your friends to listen to music while chatting in a voice channel, complete with repeat modes, flawless skipping, and high audio quality.
    - Type `!help y` and `!help p` for information about the YouTube command and the Sounds Playlist command respectively.
3. A "big emoji" feature that responds to your command with a big version of images you've saved to the bot's `bigEmoji` directory.
    - Check out `./bigEmoji/README.md` for instructions.
4. A Soundboard feature that will play sound clips that you specify while you're in a voice channel.
    - Check out `./sounds/README.md` for instructions.
5. A Role Color feature that sets your Discord role's color automatically based on the colors present in your profile picture.
    - Type `!help roleColor` to learn more.

And more!
